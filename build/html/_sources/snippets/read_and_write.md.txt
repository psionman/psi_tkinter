# Read and Write Files

## Read

Note that *line* might contain the *\n* and/or the *\r* characters. The python *read* commands do NOT strip these out.

1. Entire File

    ```python
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f_test:
        text = f_test.read()
        print(text)
    ```

1. Convert file to a list of lines:

    ```python
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f_test:
        text = f_test.read()
        text_list = text.split('\n')
        for line in text_list:
            print(line)
    ```

1. Read file as a list

    ```python
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f_test:
        text_list = f_test.readlines()
        print(text)
    ```

1. Iterate over lines in a file

    ```python
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f_test:
        line = f_test.readline()
        while line != '':
            print(line)
            line = f_test.readline()
    ```


1. Read a file in json format

    ```python
    import json

    with open(json_path, 'r') as f_json:
        json_object = json.load(f_json)
    print(json.dumps(json_object, sort_keys=True, indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))
    ```

## Write

1. Save a file in json format

    ```python
    import json

    with open(json_path, 'w') as f_json:
        json.dump(my_dict, f_json)
    ```

1. Save a file in json format in human readable form.

    ```python
    import json

    json_string = json.dumps(my_dict, sort_keys=True, indent=4, separators=(',', ': '))
    with open(json_path, 'w') as f_json:
        print(json_string, file=f_json)
    ```
